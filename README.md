# Angry-Professor--Algo

This program solves the problem, where a class will be canceled if fewer than k students arrive on time. Each student's arrival time is given in a list a, where a time â‰¤ 0 means the student was on time. The angryProfessor function counts how many students were on time and returns "YES" if the count is less than k (class canceled), or "NO" otherwise. The main method reads multiple test cases, processes each by calling the function, and writes the result to the output stream. This approach efficiently checks the condition for class cancellation for each test case.
